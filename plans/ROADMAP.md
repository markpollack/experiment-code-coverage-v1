# Roadmap: Code Coverage Experiment

> **Created**: 2026-03-01
> **Last updated**: 2026-03-01
> **Status**: Stage 1 in progress (Steps 1.0–1.3 complete, Prereq 1.4a complete)

## Overview

Grow a code coverage improvement agent through 4 variants across 5 Spring Getting Started guides. Demonstrate that knowledge injection > prompt engineering > model choice. Stage 1 builds all infrastructure (invoker, judges, dataset). Stage 2 runs variants and collects data. Stage 3 analyzes results.

> **Before every commit**: Verify ALL exit criteria for the current step are met. Do NOT remove exit criteria to mark a step complete — fulfill them.

## Stage 1: Project Setup

### Step 1.0: Design Review

**Status**: Complete (scaffolded by `markpollack/forge`)

**Deliverables**: VISION.md, DESIGN.md, ROADMAP.md populated with domain content. Project compiles.

---

### Step 1.1: Implement AgentInvoker

**Status**: Complete

**Deliverables**: `CodeCoverageAgentInvoker` — measures baseline/final JaCoCo coverage, invokes agent via AgentClient, enriches metadata for judges.

---

### Step 1.2: Write Prompts and Knowledge

**Status**: Complete

**Deliverables**: 3 prompt files (v0-naive, v1-hardened, v2-with-kb), 4 knowledge files (coverage-fundamentals, jacoco-patterns, spring-test-slices, common-gaps), experiment-config.yaml with 4 variants.

---

### Step 1.3: Populate and Verify Dataset

**Status**: Complete

**Entry criteria**:
- [x] Steps 1.0–1.2 complete

**Work items**:
- [x] CLONE 5 Spring guide repos into dataset/workspaces/
- [x] VERIFY each guide's `complete/` subdirectory compiles: `./mvnw clean compile`
- [x] VERIFY existing tests pass: `./mvnw test`
- [x] CONFIGURE workspace materialization (git clone per item)

**Exit criteria**:
- [x] All 5 dataset items resolve and build
- [x] Create: `plans/learnings/step-1.3-dataset.md`
- [x] COMMIT

**Deliverables**: 5 verified dataset items with `dataset.json` manifest, `materialize.sh` script.

---

### Step 1.4a: Promote agent-journal and Wire Exhaust Capture (Prerequisite)

**Status**: Complete

**Rationale**: TestQualityJudge (Step 1.4) needs a full audit trail from its agent-based evaluation — tool calls, thinking blocks, cost, tokens. Three upstream gaps were blocking this:
1. Execution ledger (`tuvium-runtime-core`) was stuck under private `ai.tuvium` coordinates
2. Claude SDK capture bridge was buried inside `refactoring-agent`
3. `ClaudeAgentModel.call()` discarded everything except assistant text

**Work completed**:
- [x] Created `markpollack/agent-journal` repo (BSL licensed)
- [x] Migrated + repackaged `ai.tuvium:tracking-core` → `io.github.markpollack:journal-core` (279 tests)
- [x] Promoted `claude-sdk-capture` → `claude-code-capture` module in agent-journal (28 tests)
- [x] Added `Consumer<ParsedMessage> messageListener` to `ClaudeAgentModel` (all 3 consumption paths)
- [x] Pushed to `spring-ai-community/agent-client` main (compile-scope dependency, not test-only)
- [x] Updated `refactoring-agent` imports/deps to new coordinates
- [x] Added journal-core + claude-code-capture to this project's pom.xml
- [x] E2E integration test verified: thinking blocks, tool calls, tokens, cost all captured through full pipeline

**Artifacts installed locally**:
- `io.github.markpollack:journal-core:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`
- `io.github.markpollack:claude-code-capture:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`
- `org.springaicommunity.agents:spring-ai-claude-agent:0.10.0-SNAPSHOT` (with messageListener)

### Step 1.4: Implement TestQualityJudge (Tier 3)

**Entry criteria**:
- [x] Step 1.3 complete
- [x] Step 1.4a complete (agent-journal + messageListener available)
- [ ] Read: `plans/learnings/step-1.3-dataset.md` — prior step learnings
- [ ] Read: `plans/inbox/design-review.md` — reviewer feedback
- [ ] Read: `plans/JOURNAL.md` — critical insight on agent-based judge approach

**Design decisions** (from reviews v1 + v2 + v3 + owner input):
- Agent-based judge (not `LLMJudge`): uses `AgentClient`/`ClaudeAgentModel` for filesystem navigation
- No `agent-judge-llm` dependency needed — reuse existing `spring-ai-agent-client` + `spring-ai-claude-agent`
- 2 evaluation criteria (dropped naming as subjective):
  - **Meaningful assertions** (weight 0.5): checking real behavior, not `assertTrue(true)`
  - **Exception/edge-case coverage** (weight 0.5): nulls, boundaries, error paths tested
- Agent navigates to production source; prompt says "if no direct counterpart, evaluate against all production classes in src/main/"
- `NumericalScore.normalized()` (continuous 0-1) for gradient in analysis
- Pass threshold configurable (constructor param, default 0.5)
- Use stronger model for judging than experiment agent (configurable via `AgentModel` injection)
- Timeout: use `ClaudeAgentOptions.timeout(Duration.ofMinutes(3))` — confirmed native support, default 10 min (no CompletableFuture)
- Read-only judge: use `allowedTools(List.of("Read", "Glob", "Grep"))` with `yolo(false)` — confirmed in `ClaudeAgentOptions`
- `workingDirectory` priority: request-level > goal-level > builder default > cwd — set on request only for judge
- Copy workspace to temp dir before judging — isolate from session files, build artifacts
- Never ABSTAIN from FINAL_TIER: no test files = `Judgment.fail()` with score 0.0
- Agent prompt constrains output to JSON-only; parser extracts outermost `{...}` block
- Accept functional interface for agent creation (testability seam, avoids static factory mocking)
- Clamp criterion scores to [0.0, 1.0] during parsing
- **Exhaust capture** (resolved in Step 1.4a): `ClaudeAgentModel.messageListener` → `SessionLogParser` → `PhaseCapture` → `BaseRunRecorder` → journal-core Run events. Full pipeline verified end-to-end.

**Work items**:
- [x] CHECK `ClaudeAgentOptions` for timeout config and read-only/restricted mode — confirmed: `timeout(Duration)`, `allowedTools(List)`, `disallowedTools(List)`, `yolo(boolean)`
- [ ] IMPLEMENT `TestQualityJudge` implementing `Judge` directly:
  - Constructor takes agent factory (functional interface), pass threshold
  - `judge()`: copy workspace to temp dir for isolation
  - Check for test files; if none → `Judgment.fail()` score 0.0
  - Build evaluation goal prompt with JSON-only output constraint
  - Invoke agent synchronously (try/catch), use agent-level timeout if available
  - Parse outermost `{...}` from agent output, clamp scores to [0.0, 1.0]
  - Compute weighted average → `NumericalScore.normalized()`
  - Return `Judgment` with `Check` entries per criterion, raw scores in metadata
  - Error handling: agent failure or unparseable output → `Judgment.error()`
  - Clean up temp workspace copy
- [ ] WIRE UP `JuryFactory` to accept agent factory, register `TestQualityJudge` at Tier 3 with `FINAL_TIER` policy
- [ ] WRITE unit test `TestQualityJudgeTest`:
  - Mock agent factory → wire full fluent chain (`goal().workingDirectory().run()`)
  - Verify correct score computation (50/50 weighting)
  - Verify no-test-files → FAIL with score 0.0
  - Verify malformed agent output → ERROR (not uncaught exception)
  - Verify agent exception → ERROR
  - Verify score clamping for out-of-range values
- [ ] VERIFY: `./mvnw compile` and `./mvnw test` pass

**Exit criteria**:
- [ ] TestQualityJudge compiles and passes tests
- [ ] All tests pass: `./mvnw test`
- [ ] Create: `plans/learnings/step-1.4-test-quality-judge.md`
